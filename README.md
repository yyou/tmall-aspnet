This project is based on the [tmall project](https://github.com/yyou/tmall.git)

A ASP.NET MVC project is added and the original html files will moved to the Views folder.

Again, all the stuff in this repository is for study purpose ONLY.

After checking out this repository, run

```
npm install
```

and
 
```
gulp styles
```

in command line. And then setup application for this folder in IIS or other web servers.
